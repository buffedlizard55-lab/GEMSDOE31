# GEMSDOE31 agent instructions

Before changing this repository, read the entire `README.md`, the active H31 preregistration in `knowledge/`, and the current outcome/status record. Keep the README as the recurring project charter; update the status record at the end of substantive work.

## Scientific and evidence rules

- Separate **OFFICIAL**, **OWNER-MIRROR**, **COMPUTED**, **INFERENCE** and **USER-REPORTED** claims. A hash proves byte identity to a mirror, not organizer authenticity; owner-reported leaderboard scores are not verified without an official receipt.
- Do not scrape, poll, automatically access, or manually monitor/copy DrivenData leaderboard material without prior written permission. A static official leaderboard link is permitted. Never submit/upload automatically.
- Preregister candidate physics, model, holdout, metric, buffer, seeds, and promotion gates before any fit. Do not use a weekly slot unless the candidate beats the same-run incumbent on an empirically buffered spatial holdout and passes fresh confirmation. A positive screen alone is insufficient.
- Derive the spatial collar from out-of-fold residual semivariograms on known fault traces. Never substitute an arbitrary pixel buffer or report the temporary pilot collar as an empirical range.
- Do not create a new candidate TIFF from a failed/unconfirmed experiment. Keep the legacy D2.8 reference file explicitly labeled as an owner-mirror benchmark, not a new or slot-approved candidate.
- Validate a submission GeoTIFF against the sample template: EPSG:32611, exact shape/transform, one float32 band,
  all footprint values finite in `[0,1]`, and NaN outside the footprint (an all-finite variant is written too and
  validated under its own convention). No silent clipping or zero-filled outside area. `tests/test_submission.py`
  keeps the regression test for the "Predicted values must be in range [0, 1]" error class.
- Report **both** truth proxies on every arm: the catalogue-gap holdout and the off-catalogue (SGMC) discovery proxy.
  They disagree, and the catalogue-based one must never be used to promote an arm; state the proxy's limits whenever
  a number from it is quoted.
- Never quote a proxy DTI as a competition score. Owner-reported scores carry the file's SHA-256 and the
  `USER-REPORTED` class; an organizer receipt is required before anything is reported as a score.

## Execution / Git rules

- Work only on the branch this session is attached to (`arena/01a104f4-gemsdoe31` at the time of writing);
  never switch, create or push another branch.
- Keep large input rasters and regenerable caches out of Git. Pin hashes and provenance in `registry/`.
- Run the full local check set before any PR: `python -m pytest -q`, `python -m ruff check .`,
  `python scripts/check_metric.py`, `python scripts/collect_evidence.py`, `python scripts/build_site.py`,
  `python scripts/check_site.py`. Update `registry/review_passes.json` with what each pass actually found.
- Regenerate the site from the registers; never hand-edit `docs/*.html`. If a number on the site is wrong, fix the
  artifact or the generator, not the HTML.
- Do not claim a live leaderboard score, organizer acceptance, PR, merge, or deployment without a verifiable receipt/status.
