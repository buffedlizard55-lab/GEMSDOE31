      <section><div class="section-head"><div><p class="kicker">The central question</p><h2>Why H33 may have scored well</h2></div>
        <p>A metric mechanism is not causal proof of a private score.</p></div>
        <div class="content"><p>For binary dots, write T = covered-truth kernel credit, M = total nearest-truth self-credit at dots,
          n = emitted dots and K = truth pixels. Then</p>
          <pre><code>DTI = T / [0.2 × (T + n − M) + 0.8 × K]
TPw = T; FPw = n − M; FNw = K − T.</code></pre>
          <p>Truth credit saturates at one per truth pixel. Nearby redundant predictions keep adding false-positive mass without proportional new coverage.
            Spacing dots near the kernel scale can therefore be more efficient than emitting a thick ridge. Removing a dot improves DTI only when its lost truth credit is small relative to the removed cost; distance to a known trace alone does not prove that.</p>
          <p>Re-read bytes establish H27 = D2.8 with catalogue distance &gt;1 pixel, and H33 = D2.8 with distance &gt;2 pixels.
            H33 removes exactly {rel['h27_to_h33_dots_removed']:,} H27 dots. All three share {rel['common_beyond_300m_dots']:,} dots beyond 300 m from the catalogue.
            This is catalogue-flank deletion, <strong>not an independent geophysical discovery</strong>. Equal far-field dot support does not imply equal kernel credit: removed near-catalogue dots can still cover nearby new truth.</p>
          <p>The owner's H33 archive labels the file unscored and contains no exact-byte organizer receipt for the prompt's claimed 0.2778.
            Without private truth and matched receipts, neither “highest score” nor a causal gain from the deletion is independently established.
            The zero/NaN outside encoding is a format policy, not a geological explanation.</p>
          <p><strong>Can the new file beat 0.2778?</strong> Unknown. Its local proxy metric cannot be compared numerically to a user-reported live result.
            This run did not establish a robust holdout advantage, so the responsible answer is no promotion, not a projected leaderboard score.</p></div>
